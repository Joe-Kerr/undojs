  Undojs.js - integration tests
    √ recordBatch stores batch info for sync function calls
    √ recordBatch stores batch info for async function calls
    √ recordBatch stores batch info for consecutive mixed asnyc/sync function calls
    √ recordBatch only stores those mixed async/sync batch members that are uninterrupted on the callstack
    √ recordBatch stores batch info for consecutive batch calls
    √ undo calls all commands' undo functions if part of a batch
    √ undo calls undo functions in order of commands' order of return - not order of commands' call
    √ undo calls async undo functions sequentially 

  Undojs.js - register
    √ register adds command to list
    √ register adds command name to list
    √ register defaults to null for context and cache
    √ register throws if mandatory parameters not provided
    √ register throws if execute, undo or cache not of type function
    √ register throws if duplicate name for command

  Undojs.js - recordBatch
    √ recordBatch creates new empty batch
    √ recordBatch calls execute with batch idx, name and param of its parameter
    √ recordBatch passes through return vals of execute calls
    √ recordBatch throws if parameter not an array
    √ recordBatch throws if parameter is empty array
    √ recordBatch throws if elements of paramter not objects
    √ recordBatch throws if any of the parameter functions does not have name property

  Undojs.js - execute
    √ execute calls the command by name with provided params-array
    √ execute allows to pass a single, non-array parameter w/o wrapping it in an array
    √ execute calls the command with an array as the parameter correctly
    √ execute stores the call's parameter/s, return val [and cache value]
    √ execute calls the command's cache function with the call's parameter/s
    √ execute calls cache function before execute function
    √ execute uses the context provided during register
    √ execute uses/prioritises the context provided as parameter
    √ execute temporarily stores a pending cache promise
    √ execute bails before execute function if aborting is true
    √ execute throws if called from within undo
    √ execute throws if called with an unknown name
    √ execute throws if called with invalid command info

  Undojs.js - undo
    √ undo calls a command's undo function with original params, return val [and cache val]
    √ undo calls batch commands' undo functions with original params, return val [and cache val]
    √ undo returns pending undo if user undoes while another undo is processing
    √ undo, once done, processes undos on queue
    √ undo does not enqueue an undo if there are insufficient commands left
    √ undo signals when it is done processing
    √ undo returns if command stack empty
    √ Error in undo function *will not* stop processing other undos in batch
    √ Error in undo function *will* stop processing pending undos
    √ Error in undo function resets undo state

  Undojs.js - reset
    √ reset sets aborting state
    √ reset clears execution state
    √ reset empties execution data array
    √ reset preserves references when emptying command stack
    √ reset awaits pending cache calls
    √ reset awaits currently running undo
    √ Error in reset within a processing cache function resets resetting state
    √ Error in reset within a processing undo function resets resetting state
    √ Error in reset within a cache function does not prevent awaiting a processing undo function

  Undojs.js - destroy
    √ destroy calls reset
    √ destroy empties command defintions

  Undojs.js system tests - error handling
    √ Error in execute function is propagated
    √ Error in sync cache function with sync exec function is propagated
    √ Error in sync cache function with async exec function is propagated
    √ Error in async cache function with sync exec function is propagated
    √ Error in async cache function with async exec function is propagated
    √ Error in batched excute function is propagated
    √ Error in single undo function is propagated
    √ Error in pending undo function is propagated
    √ Error in undo function of batch is propagated
    √ Evaluate results of a batch with rejected commands
    √ Error in reset within a cache function is NOT propagated
    √ Error in reset within a undo function is NOT propagated
    √ Error in cache function while resetting does not leak into new state
    √ Error in undo function while resetting does not leak into new state

  Undojs.js system tests - general
    √ Forcing next commands to wait for command batch requires awaiting command batch
    √ Series of [batch] commands are exatcly reversible
    √ Evaluation of individual results requires awaiting each result
    √ Non-awaited sync commands with mixed presence of cache functions are executed in order
    √ Async delays in execute and cache functions determine order of command stack 
    √ Non-awaited async commands are not called in order of execution but in order of returning/resolving
    √ Awaited async commands are called in order of execution
    √ A pending command cannot be undone 
    √ It is possible but unwise that an undo function calls undo
    √ It is possible but unwise to execute another command from within a command
    √ It is possible for a command to execute itself - and break the script with inf recur :(
    √ Pending commands do not leak into new state after reset
